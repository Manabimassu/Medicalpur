# Warehouse and Inventory Management System for Dental Clinic

This project is a warehouse and inventory management system for a dental clinic. The system uses a barcode scanner to efficiently track supplies.

## Previous Documentation

The first step in the development of this project was to conduct a thorough pre-documentation to fully understand the needs of the business.

### Business Management Software Selection

After assessing the needs of the company, **Odoo** was chosen as the business management software. Odoo is a complete solution that offers a number of business modules including sales, CRM, project management, warehouse management, manufacturing, financial accounting, and human resources.

### Company Floor Plan Study

A detailed floor plan study was conducted to better understand how space is organised and how supplies move through the warehouse.

### Interviews with workers and managers

Interviews were conducted with workers and managers to understand their roles, responsibilities and needs. This helped to identify specific inventory needs and to understand how the system can be designed to best support their roles.

With this pre-documentation, we are well prepared to begin development of the warehouse and inventory management system.
